# To Do Program

# Project Brief
The program is mainly developed for students to increase their productivity. The program basically performs tasks such as add tasks, edit a task, mark-as-complete tasks, set reminders for tasks, and check the time remaining.
The tasks are divided into:
Assignment tasks- These tasks are assignments for any course.
Class Sessions - These tasks are class session meetings for any course.
Office Hours Tasks - These tasks are office hours session meetings for any course.
Extra Curricular - These tasks are activities outside the course work.
Off Campus Tasks - These tasks are personal activities outside of school environment. 
The program will seek to address the issue of time management among students so that they can prioritize their tasks. The program will also help students to never miss perform tasks because of the reminders. This will result in improved productivity.
